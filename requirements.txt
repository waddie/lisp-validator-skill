# Lisp Validator - Optional Python Dependencies
#
# These dependencies are optional and enhance validation capabilities.
# The skill works without them, but some features may be unavailable.

# Tree-sitter Python library (preferred over CLI for incomplete code validation)
# More reliable than tree-sitter CLI for parsing incomplete Lisp code
tree-sitter>=0.20.0

# Lisp grammar libraries for tree-sitter
# Enable validation of incomplete code for specific dialects
tree-sitter-commonlisp>=0.0.5  # Common Lisp grammar
tree-sitter-clojure>=0.0.9      # Clojure grammar
tree-sitter-elisp>=1.3.0        # Emacs Lisp grammar

# Note: Racket/Scheme grammars are not yet available in PyPI
# For Racket/Scheme, use raco tools instead (installed separately)
